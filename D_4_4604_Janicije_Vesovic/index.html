        <h2>Band: </h2>
        <p>A rock band or pop band is a small musical ensemble that performs rock music, pop music, or a related genre. 
            A four-piece band is the most common configuration in rock and pop music. In the early years, the configuration was typically two guitarists 
            (a lead guitarist and a rhythm guitarist, with one of them singing lead vocals), a bassist, and a drummer 
            (e.g. the Beatles, KISS, and Metallica). </p>
